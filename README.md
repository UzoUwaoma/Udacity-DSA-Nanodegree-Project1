# Udacity-DSA-Nanodegree-Project1
Unscrambling computer science problems

This project, completes five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. 
The text and call records are in the `texts.csv` and `calls.csv` files respectively. 

Some analysis is carried out to answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. 

Lastly, a succinct run time analysis of the provided solutions to determine their efficiency is given in `Analysis.txt`.
